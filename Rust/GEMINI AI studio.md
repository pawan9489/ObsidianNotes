### **Module 1: High-Level Parallelism with rayon (Our Current Module)**

- **Goal:** Master easy, high-performance data parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.
    
- **Topics:** .par_iter(), map, filter, reduce, fold. Understand the work-stealing model conceptually.
    
- **Outcome:** You'll be able to parallelize complex iterator chains with a single line of code, fully utilizing your CPU cores.
    

### **Module 2: The Async Deep Dive - From First Principles**

- **Goal:** To truly master async, we will build our own simple async runtime, guided by the principles in your "Async Rust" book.
    
- **Key Resources:** Flitton & Morton's "Async Rust", especially chapters 2, 3, 4, and 10.
    
- **Topics:**
    
    1. **The Future Trait:** We will manually implement the Future trait to understand its core poll method.
        
    2. **Poll, Context, and the Waker:** We'll demystify these core types. We will see exactly how a Waker is created and used to notify the executor that a task is ready to be polled again.
        
    3. **Pinning:** We'll finally tackle what Pin is for and why it's necessary for async code.
        
    4. **Building an Executor & Scheduler:** We'll write our own simple, single-threaded executor that can run multiple futures to completion. This will be our "event loop."
        
    5. **Building Async Primitives:** We'll explore how to build our own async-aware primitives, like the queues and networking components described in the book, to understand how libraries like Tokio are constructed.
        

### **Module 3: Compile-Time Programming (const & const fn)**

- **Goal:** Understand how to shift computations from runtime to compile-time.
    
- **Topics:** const vs. static, const fn, and the limitations and expanding capabilities of Rust's const evaluation system.
    
- **Outcome:** You'll be able to write more performant code by ensuring some calculations happen only once, during compilation.
    

### **Module 4: The Magic of Macros**

- **Goal:** Learn how to write code that writes code, reducing boilerplate and creating powerful DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages).
    
- **Topics:**
    
    1. **Declarative Macros (macro_rules!)**: The pattern-matching system.
        
    2. **Procedural Macros**: A deep dive into #[derive], attribute-like, and function-like macros. We'll see how libraries like serde work.
        
- **Outcome:** You'll be able to read and write all forms of Rust macros, demystifying a huge part of the ecosystem.
    

### **Module 5: Capstone Project 1 - A Standard gRPC Microservice**

- **Goal:** Build a practical, high-performance microservice using industry-standard tools.
    
- **Stack:** tokio, tonic (for gRPC), serde (for serialization), eyre (for error handling).
    
- **Project:** We'll build a service for a simple domain, for example, a "short URL" generator or a basic key-value store.
    
- **Outcome:** You will have built and containerized (with Docker) a complete, production-ready Rust microservice.
    

### **Module 6: Statistics and Data Analysis in Rust**

- **Goal:** Become proficient in performing statistical analysis and data manipulation in a high-performance context, guided by your "Statistics with Rust" book.
    
- **Key Resource:** Nakamura's "Statistics with Rust".
    
- **Topics:** We'll follow the book's structure:
    
    1. **Foundations & Tooling:** Setting up a data analysis environment. Mastering the core crates: ndarray (for numerical computing) and polars (for data frames).
        
    2. **Data Handling & Preprocessing:** Implementing the full data cleaning pipeline: loading, parsing, handling missing values, transformation, and feature engineering.
        
    3. **Core Statistics:** Implementing descriptive and inferential statistics. We'll cover measures of central tendency, probability distributions, hypothesis testing (t-tests, Chi-Square), and regression analysis (Linear, Multiple, Polynomial).
        
    4. **Machine Learning:** We will implement several ML models using crates like smartcore and linfa. This will include Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and basic Neural Networks. We'll also cover model evaluation and validation.
        

### **Module 7: Capstone Project 2 - A Statistical Prediction Microservice**

- **Goal:** Synthesize your knowledge of async services and statistics to build an "ML-inference" microservice.
    
- **Stack:** tonic, tokio, polars, smartcore or linfa, serde.
    
- **Project Idea:** A gRPC service that provides real-time predictions.
    
    1. **Offline Step:** We will train a model (e.g., a logistic regression model for classification) using the techniques from Module 6 and serialize the trained model to a file.
        
    2. **Online Service:** We'll build a gRPC server that loads the pre-trained model on startup.
        
    3. **API:** It will expose an endpoint like rpc Predict(Features) returns (Prediction).
        
    4. **Logic:** The service will receive a request with a set of features, run them through the loaded model, and return the prediction.
        
- **Outcome:** A practical demonstration of "ML in production" using Rust, showcasing its power for both high-performance networking and high-performance computation.
