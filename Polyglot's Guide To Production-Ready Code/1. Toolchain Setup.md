## What is a Toolchain?

A **toolchain** in software development is a set of programming tools used to perform a complex software development task or to create a software product. For compiled languages like Haskell and Rust, this typically includes:

* **Compiler:** Translates source code into machine code or an intermediate bytecode (e.g., GHC for Haskell, `rustc` for Rust).
* **Build System/Manager:** Automates the process of compiling source code, managing dependencies, linking libraries, and producing executables or libraries (e.g., Cabal/Stack for Haskell, Cargo for Rust).
* **Package Manager:** Helps in downloading, installing, and managing external libraries (dependencies) that your project uses. Often integrated with the build system.
* **Language Server (Optional but common):** Provides features like autocompletion, go-to-definition, and error checking in code editors (e.g., HLS for Haskell, `rust-analyzer` for Rust).
* **Version Manager (Often separate or integrated):** Allows developers to install and switch between different versions of the compiler and other tools (e.g., GHCup for Haskell, rustup for Rust).
* **Testing Frameworks:** Tools to write and run tests.
* **Linters/Formatters:** Tools to ensure code quality and consistent style.

Effectively, a toolchain provides the essential infrastructure to go from source code to a running application or a reusable library.

## Installation of Toolchains

Here we'll look at how to get the basic toolchains up and running. The commands shown are generally for Unix-like environments (such as Linux or macOS).

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
For Haskell, **GHCup** is a common and recommended way to install and manage the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC), the Cabal build tool, Stack (another build tool), and the Haskell Language Server (HLS).

**1. Install GHCup:**
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://get-ghcup.haskell.org](https://get-ghcup.haskell.org) | sh
```
Follow the on-screen prompts. This script will install `ghcup` itself and typically prompt you to install recommended versions of GHC, Cabal, and HLS.

**2. Install Core Components (if not done during `ghcup` setup):**

* **Install GHC (latest recommended):**
    ```bash
    ghcup install ghc recommended
    ghcup set ghc recommended
    ```
* **Install Cabal (build tool, latest):**
    ```bash
    ghcup install cabal latest
    ghcup set cabal latest
    ```
* **Install Stack (alternative build tool/project manager, latest):**
    ```bash
    ghcup install stack latest
    ghcup set stack latest
    ```
* **Install Haskell Language Server (HLS):**
    ```bash
    ghcup install hls recommended # Installs HLS compatible with your 'recommended' GHC
    ghcup set hls recommended
    ```
    After installation, `ghcup` might suggest adding its bin directory to your PATH. Ensure this is done (e.g., by sourcing your shell's configuration file like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, or opening a new terminal).

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
ghc --version
cabal --version
stack --version
haskell-language-server-wrapper --version
```

tab: Rust
For Rust, **rustup** is the official and recommended tool to install and manage Rust versions and associated tools like Cargo (package manager and build system).

**1. Install rustup:**
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs) | sh
```
Follow the on-screen prompts. It will usually ask you to proceed with the installation (option 1 is typical). This installs `rustup` and the latest stable Rust toolchain (including `rustc`, `cargo`, `rustfmt`, `clippy`).

It will also attempt to configure your PATH environment variable. You'll likely need to source your shell's configuration file or open a new terminal for the changes to take effect.

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup --version
```
~~~

## Switching Toolchain Versions

Once installed, you'll often need to switch between different versions of compilers or toolchains for different projects.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
**Using GHCup:** (Manages GHC, Cabal, Stack, HLS versions)

* **List available GHC versions:**
    ```bash
    ghcup list ghc
    ```
* **Install a specific GHC version:**
    ```bash
    ghcup install ghc <version_number>
    # Example: ghcup install ghc 9.2.8
    ```
* **Set a default GHC version system-wide:**
    ```bash
    ghcup set ghc <version_number_or_alias>
    # Example: ghcup set ghc 9.2.8
    # Or: ghcup set ghc recommended
    ```
    You can do the same for `cabal`, `stack`, and `hls`:
    ```bash
    ghcup list cabal
    ghcup install cabal <version_number>
    ghcup set cabal <version_number_or_alias>
    ```

**Using Stack (Project-specific GHC):**

Stack primarily manages GHC versions on a per-project basis through the `resolver` field in the `stack.yaml` file.

* **Specify GHC version in `stack.yaml`:**
    Edit your project's `stack.yaml` file:
    ```yaml
    resolver: lts-20.10 # Uses GHC specified by Long Term Support snapshot 20.10
    # OR for a specific GHC version:
    # resolver: ghc-9.2.8
    ```
    When you run `stack build` or other `stack` commands, Stack will automatically download and use the GHC version specified by the resolver for that project.
* **Using a different GHC temporarily with Stack:**
    You can tell stack to use a different GHC version for a single command:
    ```bash
    stack --resolver ghc-8.10.7 exec -- ghc --version
    stack --resolver lts-18.28 build
    ```

tab: Rust
**Using rustup:** (Manages `rustc`, `cargo`, and associated components)

* **Update all installed toolchains (and rustup itself):**
    ```bash
    rustup update
    ```
* **Install a specific toolchain channel (stable, beta, nightly):**
    ```bash
    rustup toolchain install stable
    rustup toolchain install beta
    rustup toolchain install nightly
    ```
* **Install a specific version:**
    ```bash
    rustup toolchain install <version_number>
    # Example: rustup toolchain install 1.65.0
    ```
* **List installed toolchains:**
    ```bash
    rustup toolchain list
    ```
* **Set the default toolchain system-wide:**
    ```bash
    rustup default <toolchain_name>
    # Example: rustup default stable
    # rustup default nightly
    # rustup default 1.65.0
    ```
* **Override the toolchain for the current directory (project-specific):**
    This creates a `rust-toolchain.toml` file (or `rust-toolchain` for older versions) in the current directory.
    ```bash
    rustup override set <toolchain_name>
    # Example: rustup override set nightly
    # To clear the override: rustup override unset
    ```
* **Run a command with a specific toolchain temporarily:**
    This doesn't change the default or any directory override.
    ```bash
    cargo +<toolchain_name> <command>
    # Example: cargo +nightly build
    # Example: rustc +1.65.0 --version
    ```
* **Uninstall a toolchain:**
    ```bash
    rustup toolchain uninstall <toolchain_name>
    ```

## Core Components Management

A brief overview of how core language components are managed.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
Manages GHC (compiler), Cabal (build tool), Stack (build tool/project manager), and HLS (language server) often separately, though `ghcup` can manage all of them.

tab: Rust
`rustup` manages toolchains (stable, beta, nightly) which bundle `rustc` (compiler), `cargo` (build tool/package manager), and other components like `rust-analyzer` (language server via `rustup component add`), `clippy` (linter), `rustfmt` (formatter).
~~~

---

## Project Initialization

How to start a new project.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **Using `cabal` (interactive):**
  ```bash
  cabal init
  ```
* **Using `stack` (can use templates):**
  ```bash
  stack new <project_name> [template_name]
  # Example: stack new myproject simple
  # Example: stack new myproject # uses default template
  ```

tab: Rust
* **For a library project:**
  ```bash
  cargo new <project_name>
  ```
* **For a binary (executable) project:**
  ```bash
  cargo new <project_name> --bin
  ```
~~~

---

## Build Tools & Package Manager

The primary tools used for building projects and managing dependencies.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **`cabal-install` (commonly referred to as `cabal`):** A build tool and package manager for Haskell.
* **`stack`:** Another popular build tool and project manager that provides curated package sets (Stackage) and manages GHC versions.

tab: Rust
* **`cargo`:** The official build tool and package manager for Rust. It handles compiling code, downloading dependencies, running tests, and more.
~~~

---

## Project File(s)

Configuration files defining the project structure and dependencies.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **For `cabal` projects:**
    * `.cabal` file: Defines package metadata, dependencies, build targets (libraries, executables, tests).
    * `Setup.hs`: A Haskell script for custom build logic (often minimal or auto-generated).
    * `cabal.project` (optional): For multi-package projects or to specify global build options.
* **For `stack` projects:**
    * `stack.yaml`: Defines the GHC version (resolver), package locations, and external dependencies.
    * `package.yaml`: Often used with the `hpack` tool to generate the `.cabal` file. Simpler format for defining package info.
    * `.cabal` file: Still present and used by GHC/Cabal under the hood, often generated by `hpack` from `package.yaml`.

tab: Rust
* **`Cargo.toml`:** The manifest file for a Rust project (called a "crate"). It contains metadata, dependencies, build profiles, and target definitions.
~~~

---

## Dependency Source

Where the build tools fetch external libraries/packages from.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **Hackage:** The primary central package repository for Haskell. `cabal` primarily uses this.
* **Stackage:** Curated sets of packages from Hackage known to build together. `stack` uses Stackage by default for its "resolvers" (snapshots), but can also use packages directly from Hackage or Git repositories.

tab: Rust
* **crates.io:** The official central package registry for Rust crates. `cargo` uses this by default.
~~~

---

## Lock File

Files that record the exact versions of dependencies used in a build, ensuring reproducability.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **`cabal`:**
    * `cabal.project.freeze`: Generated when you run `cabal freeze` or during a build if a `cabal.project` file exists and version constraints allow. It locks down the versions of all dependencies.
* **`stack`:**
    * `stack.yaml.lock`: While `stack.yaml` specifies a resolver (which is already a consistent set of package versions from Stackage), `stack.yaml.lock` (implicitly managed by Stack) can lock down the exact revisions of git dependencies or other non-Stackage sources if specified in `stack.yaml`. The resolver itself acts as a primary lock.

tab: Rust
* **`Cargo.lock`:** Automatically generated and updated by `cargo` when dependencies are added or builds occur. It records the exact versions and sources of all transitive dependencies.
~~~

---

## Language Server

Provides IDE-like features in code editors.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
**Haskell Language Server (HLS)**

* **Installation:**
    ```bash
    ghcup install hls <version_or_use_recommended_for_ghc_version>
    # Or, if you installed ghcup and set a GHC version:
    # ghcup install hls
    ```
* **Features:**
    * Autocompletion
    * Type information on hover
    * Live diagnostics (errors/warnings)
    * Go-to-definition
    * Linting (often integrates with Hlint)
    * Formatting (integrates with tools like Ormolu, Fourmolu, Brittany)

tab: Rust
**`rust-analyzer`** (official successor to RLS)

* **Installation:**
    ```bash
    rustup component add rust-analyzer
    ```
* **Features:**
    * Autocompletion
    * Type information and inlay hints
    * Live diagnostics
    * Go-to-definition, implementation, type definition
    * Smart assists and refactorings (e.g., extract variable/function)
    * Macro expansion viewing
~~~

---

## Compiler

The core tool that translates source code.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
**`ghc` (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)**

* **Interactive (REPL):**
    * `ghci`: The interactive environment for GHC.
    * Usually launched via build tools for project context:
        ```bash
        cabal repl
        ```
        ```bash
        stack ghci
        ```
* **Invocation:**
    * Typically invoked indirectly through `cabal` or `stack` (e.g., `cabal build`, `stack build`).
    * Direct invocation for single files: `ghc MyFile.hs`

tab: Rust
**`rustc` (Rust Compiler)**

* **Interactive (REPL):**
    * No official REPL built into `rustc` itself.
    * Third-party crates like `evcxr_repl` provide a REPL experience (often used with Jupyter).
        ```bash
        # Installation if needed (once per system)
        # cargo install evcxr_repl 
        evcxr # to run
        ```
* **Invocation:**
    * Typically invoked indirectly through `cargo` (e.g., `cargo build`).
    * Direct invocation for single files: `rustc main.rs`
~~~

---

## View Module Structure

Understanding how modules in your project are organized.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* Manual inspection of `.cabal` file (exposed-modules) and source code imports.
* **Haddock documentation:** Running `cabal haddock` or `stack haddock` generates HTML documentation that shows module interfaces.
* `graphmod` (older tool, might require separate installation): Can generate a module dependency graph.
    ```bash
    # Might require: cabal install graphmod
    # graphmod MyProject.cabal | dot -Tpng -o modules.png
    ```

tab: Rust
* **Using `cargo-modules` (requires installation):**
    ```bash
    # Install once: cargo install cargo-modules
    cargo modules list tree
    cargo modules generate graph # (Requires Graphviz to be installed)
    ```
    The generated graph can be converted to an image:
    ```bash
    # dot -Tpng modules.dot -o modules.png
    ```
* Manual inspection of `src/lib.rs` or `src/main.rs` and `mod` declarations.
~~~

---

## View Dependencies

Listing project dependencies.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **Using `cabal`:**
    * To see a flat list of direct and indirect dependencies:
      ```bash
      # May need to configure the project first if not done, e.g., cabal build --dry-run
      cabal list-dependencies 
      ```
    * To see resolved versions (after a build or freeze): Inspect `cabal.project.freeze`.
* **Using `stack`:**
    * List dependencies:
      ```bash
      stack ls dependencies
      ```
    * Generate a dependency graph (requires Graphviz):
      ```bash
      stack dot --external | dot -Tpng -o dep.png
      ```

tab: Rust
* **Using `cargo tree` (built-in):**
    * Show dependency tree:
      ```bash
      cargo tree
      ```
    * Show reverse dependencies (who depends on a specific crate):
      ```bash
      cargo tree -i <crate_name>
      # Example: cargo tree -i serde
      ```
~~~

---

## Add Dependency

Incorporating new libraries into your project.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **`cabal`:**
    1.  Manually edit the `build-depends` section of your project's `.cabal` file.
        Example: `build-depends: base ^>=4.17.0.0, text ^>=2.0, vector ^>=0.13.0.0`
    2.  Then, run `cabal build` or `cabal update` (to fetch package info if new).
* **`stack`:**
    1.  **If using `package.yaml` (with `hpack`):**
        * Add the dependency to the `dependencies:` section of `package.yaml`.
            Example: `dependencies: - text - vector`
        * `stack` will usually handle adding it to `stack.yaml`'s `extra-deps` if it's not in the current resolver, or prompt you.
    2.  **If editing `.cabal` file directly:** Similar to `cabal`, edit `build-depends`.
    3.  **For packages not in your resolver (LTS snapshot):** You might need to add them to the `extra-deps:` section in `stack.yaml`.
        Example in `stack.yaml`:
        ```yaml
        extra-deps:
        - some-package-1.2.3
        - git: [https://github.com/user/repo.git](https://github.com/user/repo.git)
          commit: <commit_hash>
        ```
    4. Then run `stack build`.

tab: Rust
* **Using `cargo add` (from `cargo-edit` tool, often bundled or easy to install):**
    ```bash
    cargo add <crate_name>
    # For a development-only dependency:
    cargo add <crate_name> --dev
    # To add a specific version:
    cargo add <crate_name>@<version>
    ```
    If `cargo add` is not available (older Rust or minimal install), you manually edit the `[dependencies]` or `[dev-dependencies]` section of `Cargo.toml`:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    serde = "1.0"
    tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
    ```
    Then `cargo build` will fetch and compile them.
~~~

---

## Remove Dependency

Removing libraries from your project.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **`cabal`:**
    1.  Manually edit the `.cabal` file to remove the dependency from the `build-depends` section.
    2.  Run `cabal build` or clean the project.
* **`stack`:**
    1.  **If using `package.yaml`:** Remove the dependency from `package.yaml`.
    2.  If it was in `extra-deps` in `stack.yaml` and no longer needed by any package, remove it from there too.
    3.  Run `stack build` or clean the project.

tab: Rust
* **Using `cargo remove` (from `cargo-edit` tool):**
    ```bash
    cargo remove <crate_name>
    ```
    If `cargo remove` is not available, manually edit `Cargo.toml` to remove the line for the dependency. Then `cargo build` or `cargo clean` might be needed.
~~~

---

## Build Project

Compiling your project's code.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **`cabal`:**
  ```bash
  cabal build
  ```
* **`stack`:**
  ```bash
  stack build
  ```

tab: Rust
* **For a debug build (default, faster compilation, more debug info):**
  ```bash
  cargo build
  ```
* **For a release build (optimized, slower compilation, faster runtime):**
  ```bash
  cargo build --release
  ```
~~~

---

## Run Executable

Executing the compiled program.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **`cabal`:**
  ```bash
  cabal run [<executable_name_if_multiple>] [-- <arguments_for_your_program>]
  # Example: cabal run
  # Example: cabal run my-exe -- --port 8080
  ```
* **`stack`:**
  ```bash
  stack exec <executable_name> [-- <arguments_for_your_program>]
  # If your project has one executable or one is default:
  # stack exec my-project-exe -- --verbose
  # To run the main project executable (if configured simply):
  # stack run [-- <args>]
  ```

tab: Rust
* **Run debug build:**
  ```bash
  cargo run [-- <arguments_for_your_program>]
  # Example: cargo run -- --input data.txt
  ```
* **Run release build:**
  ```bash
  cargo run --release [-- <arguments_for_your_program>]
  ```
  If you have multiple binaries, specify which one: `cargo run --bin <binary_name>`.
~~~

---

## Run Tests

Executing automated tests for your project.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* **`cabal`:**
  ```bash
  cabal test
  ```
* **`stack`:**
  ```bash
  stack test
  ```

tab: Rust
```bash
cargo test
```
You can also run tests for a specific package, library, binary, or test function.
Example: `cargo test --test <test_name_in_tests_dir>`
Example: `cargo test my_module::my_test_function`
~~~

---

## Code Checking (Fast)

Quickly check for errors without full compilation/linking.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
* Loading the project into GHCi is often the quickest way to check types and syntax:
    ```bash
    cabal repl
    ```
    ```bash
    stack ghci
    ```
    Then in GHCi: `:load MyModule` or `:reload`.
* Build tools might have options for type checking only, but GHCi is common.
    `ghc -fno-code MyModule.hs` (checks a single file without generating object code).

tab: Rust
```bash
cargo check
```
This command compiles the project enough to check for errors but doesn't produce the final executable, making it significantly faster than a full `cargo build`.
~~~

---

## Language Editions

Mechanisms for evolving the language without breaking existing code.

~~~tabs
tab: Haskell
Haskell has language standards and GHC-specific extensions.
* **`Haskell98`**, **`Haskell2010`**: Official language reports defining a base set of features.
* **GHC Extensions**: GHC implements many language extensions beyond `Haskell2010`. These can be enabled per-file (e.g., `{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}`) or per-project in the `.cabal` file (`default-extensions` or `other-extensions`).
* **`GHC2021`**, **`GHC2024`**: These are not new language standards in the vein of `Haskell2010`, but rather bundles of commonly used GHC extensions that are enabled by default when `GHC2021` (or `GHC2024`) is specified (e.g., in the `.cabal` file `default-language: GHC2021`). This simplifies managing common sets of extensions.

tab: Rust
Rust uses "Editions" to introduce changes that would otherwise be backward incompatible. Code from different editions can be linked together.
* **`Rust 2015`**: The first edition.
* **`Rust 2018`**: Introduced changes like `async/.await` (initial syntax path), module path clarity.
* **`Rust 2021`**: Stabilized more features, improvements to closures, `Result` and `Option` handling.
* **`Rust 2024`**: The latest edition (as of late 2024), focusing on refining existing features, with "gen Z" `async fn` and `return-position impl Trait` in traits (RPITITs) being notable.
You specify the edition in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[package]
name = "my_crate"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021" # or "2018", "2024"
```
~~~
