### **Book Index: From Monolith to Cosmos (Definitive Edition)**

This book is structured as a comprehensive, hands-on journey where you, the reader, take ownership of "Shlink"—a URL shortener service—as if you're the lead engineer in a product-based company. Starting from a simple idea, you'll iteratively design, build, extend, and scale Shlink chapter by chapter, facing real-world challenges and applying solutions piece by piece. Each chapter builds directly on the previous ones, with labs that evolve the Shlink codebase incrementally. You'll use Rust throughout for practical, production-grade implementation, emphasizing intermediate-level concepts like async programming, error handling, and concurrency.

The focus is on mastery: system design principles, modern software architectures, and often-overlooked topics like developer experience (DevEx) tools to enable fast local iteration without heavy production setups. To keep it comprehensive, the book is divided into two volumes:

- **Volume 1: Foundations to Distribution** (Parts 0–4): Covers core building blocks, monoliths, scaling pains, decomposition, and foundational distributed systems.
- **Volume 2: Frontiers to Mastery** (Parts 5–7): Dives into advanced patterns, production hardening, and capstone challenges.

Expect a deep, year-long journey if needed—prioritize quality over speed. Labs include "Pain Labs" (demonstrating failures), "Sandbox Labs" (isolated experiments), and "Shlink Labs" (extending your product). A companion GitHub repo provides starter code, diagrams, and full solutions.
